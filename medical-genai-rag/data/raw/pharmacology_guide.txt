PHARMACOLOGY OF COMMON MEDICATIONS: A CLINICAL GUIDE

1. Analgesics

1.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
Mechanism: Inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis
- COX-1: Constitutive enzyme involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet aggregation, and renal blood flow
- COX-2: Inducible enzyme primarily involved in inflammation and pain

Common NSAIDs:
- Ibuprofen: Non-selective COX inhibitor. Dose: 200-800mg q6-8h. Max: 3200mg/day
- Naproxen: Non-selective, longer half-life. Dose: 250-500mg q12h
- Celecoxib: Selective COX-2 inhibitor. Dose: 100-200mg q12h
- Aspirin: Irreversibly inhibits COX-1, used for antiplatelet therapy at low doses (75-325mg)

Adverse effects: GI bleeding, renal impairment, cardiovascular risk (especially COX-2 selective), hypertension

1.2 Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)
Mechanism: Central inhibition of COX, exact mechanism not fully understood
Dose: 325-1000mg q4-6h. Max: 4000mg/day (2000mg in liver disease)
Adverse effects: Hepatotoxicity in overdose (antidote: N-acetylcysteine)

1.3 Opioids
Mechanism: Activate mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors in the CNS and periphery
- Morphine: Gold standard, IV/oral. 10mg IV = 30mg oral
- Oxycodone: Semi-synthetic, oral. 1.5x potency of morphine
- Fentanyl: Synthetic, 50-100x more potent than morphine. Transdermal and IV forms
- Tramadol: Weak opioid + SNRI properties. Lower abuse potential
- Codeine: Prodrug converted to morphine by CYP2D6

Adverse effects: Respiratory depression, constipation, nausea, sedation, tolerance, dependence

2. Antibiotics

2.1 Beta-Lactams
Mechanism: Inhibit cell wall synthesis by binding penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)
- Penicillins: Amoxicillin, ampicillin (gram-positive coverage + some gram-negative)
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate: Extended spectrum with beta-lactamase inhibitor
- Cephalosporins: Cephalexin (1st gen), cefuroxime (2nd), ceftriaxone (3rd), cefepime (4th)
- Carbapenems: Meropenem, imipenem (broadest spectrum)

2.2 Fluoroquinolones
Mechanism: Inhibit DNA gyrase (gram-negative) and topoisomerase IV (gram-positive)
- Ciprofloxacin: Gram-negative coverage, UTIs, GI infections
- Levofloxacin: Respiratory infections, broader coverage
- Moxifloxacin: Enhanced gram-positive and anaerobic coverage
Adverse effects: Tendinopathy, QT prolongation, CNS effects, C. difficile risk

2.3 Macrolides
Mechanism: Bind 50S ribosomal subunit, inhibit translocation
- Azithromycin: Long half-life, 5-day course. Community-acquired pneumonia, STIs
- Clarithromycin: H. pylori triple therapy, respiratory infections
Adverse effects: GI upset, QT prolongation, drug interactions (CYP3A4)

3. Cardiovascular Medications

3.1 Statins
Mechanism: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors - reduce cholesterol synthesis
- Atorvastatin: High-intensity (40-80mg), low-intensity (10-20mg)
- Rosuvastatin: Most potent (5-40mg)
- Simvastatin: Moderate intensity, more drug interactions
Adverse effects: Myopathy, rhabdomyolysis (rare), hepatotoxicity, diabetes risk

3.2 Antihypertensives
ACE Inhibitors (enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril):
- Block conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II
- Side effects: Dry cough, hyperkalemia, angioedema, teratogenic

ARBs (losartan, valsartan, olmesartan):
- Block AT1 receptors
- Similar benefits to ACEi without cough
- Side effects: Hyperkalemia, teratogenic

Calcium Channel Blockers:
- Dihydropyridines (amlodipine, nifedipine): Vasodilation
- Non-dihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil): Also reduce heart rate

4. Psychiatric Medications

4.1 Antidepressants
SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors):
- Fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram
- First-line for depression and anxiety
- Side effects: GI upset, sexual dysfunction, serotonin syndrome risk

SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors):
- Venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine
- Also useful for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia
- Side effects: Similar to SSRIs plus hypertension at higher doses

4.2 Anxiolytics
Benzodiazepines:
- Diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam
- Enhance GABA-A receptor activity
- Risks: Dependence, respiratory depression, falls in elderly

Buspirone:
- 5-HT1A partial agonist
- Non-sedating, no dependence risk
- Slower onset (2-4 weeks)

5. Diabetes Medications

5.1 Metformin
Mechanism: Reduces hepatic glucose output, increases insulin sensitivity
First-line for T2DM. Dose: 500-2000mg/day
Adverse effects: GI upset, lactic acidosis (rare), B12 deficiency

5.2 Insulin
Types by onset/duration:
- Rapid-acting: Lispro, aspart, glulisine (onset 15min, duration 3-5h)
- Short-acting: Regular insulin (onset 30min, duration 6-8h)
- Intermediate: NPH (onset 2h, duration 12-18h)
- Long-acting: Glargine, detemir, degludec (onset 2-4h, duration 20-42h)
